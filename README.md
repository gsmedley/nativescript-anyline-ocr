# nativescript-anyline-ocr

Sample project to show integration with anyline ocr

See the angular demo, regular demo is not done.

cd src
npm run demo-angular.android

## Installation

Describe your plugin installation steps. Ideally it would be something like:

```javascript
tns plugin add nativescript-anyline-ocr
```

Did not want to ship anyline files, so place your "anylinesdk-14.aar" in src/platforms/android before building.
